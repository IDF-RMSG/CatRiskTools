CatRiskTools
=================

Welcome to the help page and documentation of the CatRiskTools risk model catalogue

CatRiskTools is a public good resource to help people find out where catastrophe risk models are available in the World - and locations which are not well served by models. 

The catalogue can be searched by country, by peril (hazard), and by model provider.
Searches can be carried out using the drop down boxes, by clicking on the map, or by clicking on the bar charts.

Models matching the search are shown at the bottom of the screen. By clicking on a model record, users will see further detail on that model, in a new screen.

Risk analysis platforms offer tools to analyse risk in multiple locations (often with global coverage) but do not necessarily offer a ready-to-use model for a particular country and peril. Risk analysis platforms are not included in this catalogue. Please see the provided list of [*Global Platforms*](index_globalplatforms.rst) for some key resources.

Risk profiles present the results and interpretation of risk analyses, and are also not included in this catalogue. Please see the provided list of [*Risk Profiles*](index_riskprofiles.rst) for key resources.

CatRiskTools was developed by the `Insurance Development Forum (IDF) Risk Modelling Steering Group (RMSG) <https://www.insdevforum.org/working-groups/rmsg/>`_ and is maintained by IDF RMSG and RenaissanceRe.

The dataset can be interrogated as a Tableau workbook, located on the `IDF Tableau profile <https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/insdevforum/viz/CatRiskTools/CatRiskTools>`_ (soon to be available directly on the IDF website).
