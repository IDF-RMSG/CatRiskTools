Risk profiles
=================

These sources provide risk profiles which provide the results of previous risk analyses. They can be used to understand the distribution and drivers of risk in many countries. 

Frequently, risk profiles are conducted at national scale, with regional and/or global data and assumptions. 
While they provide a reasonable estimate, they are frequently not intended for detailed design of infrastructure or adaptation strategies. It is important to understand the methods, date of analysis and level of analysis before use.
