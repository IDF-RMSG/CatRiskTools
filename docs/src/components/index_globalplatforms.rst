Global risk analysis platforms
==================================

The platforms listed below provide the functionality to analyse risk, in free and often open-souce environments.
Please see the resource pages for detailed information. This resource will be update with more detail over time.


| Platform      | Description | URL |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| OpenQuake (GEM Foundation) | The OpenQuake Platform, by the GEM Foundation is a web-based platform offers an interactive environment in which users can access, manipulate, share and add data, and explore models and tools for integrated assessment of earthquake risk. | https://platform.openquake.org/ |
| RiskScape (NIWA and GNS Science) | RiskScape is an open-source spatial data processing application used for **multi-hazard risk analysis**. RiskScape is highly customisable, letting modellers tailor the risk analysis to suit the problem domain and input data being modelled.  | https://riskscape.org.nz/ |
| CAPRA | The CAPRA (Probabilistic Risk Assessment) Platform is an initiative that aims to strengthen the institutional capacity for assessing, understanding and communicating disaster risk, with the ultimate goal of integrating disaster risk information into development policies and programs. Under the CAPRA platform, government, institutions, private companies and other agencies address specific development challenges and meet disaster risk information needs through specialized software applications, extensive documentation, consultancy and advisory services, hands-on practical training and other complementary services. | https://ecapra.org/ |
| InaSAFE | InaSAFE is free software that produces realistic natural hazard **impact scenarios** for better planning, preparedness and response activities. It provides a simple but rigorous way to combine data from scientists, local governments and communities to provide insights into the likely impacts of future disaster events. | http://inasafe.org/ |
| RASOR | The Rapid Analysis and Spatialisation Of Risk (RASOR) project will develop a platform to perform multi-hazard risk analysis to support the full cycle of disaster management, including targeted support to critical infrastructure monitoring and climate change impact assessment. | http://www.rasor-project.eu/ |
| Oasis Loss Modelling Framework | The Oasis Loss Modelling Framework provides an open source platform for developing, deploying and executing catastrophe models. It uses a full simulation engine and makes no restrictions on the modelling approach. Models are packaged in a standard format and the components can be from any source, such as model vendors, academic and research groups.  | https://oasislmf.org/ |
