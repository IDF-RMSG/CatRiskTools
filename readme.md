CatRiskTools is a catalogue of Catastrophe risk models, used by the insurance industry and beyond, to estimate the severity and frequency of disasters losses.

If you're not familiar with catastrophe models, please look at https://oasislmf.org/oasis-information-library/section-4-catastrophe-modelling-in-the-developing-world

The new 2023 version of CRT has been created in collaboration between the IDF Risk Modelling Steering Group and RennaissanceRe. Credits: Emmet McCormack and Andy Kenna.

It operates on Tableau public and relies on the contribution of model details by the model vendors creating those models.
